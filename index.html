      <p>My name is Kathleen, but you can call me 'Kat.' I am a 20-something creative thinker and 
        avid puppy-lover. One of my biggest dreams is to have a bernese mountain dog puppy who can accompany my family and I on our wild and fun adventures. I love to read fantasy (Harry Potter anyone??), and I enjoy a well-played game of Dungeons and Dragons with friends and family (my favourite class is barbarian! #mestrong). I love exploring beautiful green spaces around my Canadian city and frequently stop on the side of the road to save new locations to come back to later. I am the photographer of my family, and feel best when I have a dslr around my neck, my finger poised on the shutter. I am married to my best friend and I am a mother to the coolest kids I've ever met. They're brave and kind and smart and totally awesome.
        I myself am the 4th child of 6 rowdy fun-loving kids who are all making their way in this world, and I am excited
        to see where my path takes me.

        With a whopping 42 million people living within its borders, and more arriving daily,
        Canada is a country that is not only big in its geographical prowess, but big in heart as well.
        Second only to Russia in geographical expansive size, this beautiful country boasts breath-taking
        views, adventurous National Parks, and a gorgeous mix of cultures from across
        the globe.
