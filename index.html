      <p>My name is Kathleen Rivera, but you can call me 'Kat.' I am a 20-something creative thinker and 
        avid puppy-lover. I love to read fantasy (Harry Potter anyone??), and explore beautiful green spaces around my Canadian city.
        I am the 4th child of 6 rowdy fun-loving kids who are all making their way in this world, and I am excited
        to see where my path takes me. I daydream a lot, so I figured it was time to go to school and learn how to 
        turn my ideas into a career. I can't wait for what's to come this semester. Let's do this! </p>

        With a whopping 42 million people living within its borders, and more arriving daily,
        Canada is a country that is not only big in its geographical prowess, but big in heart as well.
        Second only to Russia in geographical expansive size, this beautiful country boasts breath-taking
        views, adventurous National Parks, and a gorgeous mix of cultures from across
        the globe.
