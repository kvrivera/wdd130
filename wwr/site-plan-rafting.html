        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Whitewater Rafting</i> is a company founded by Gene Rivers.
        Gene began taking groups of friends and family out on the Hartview
        River Rapids for the sheer sake of adventure and introducing others
        to the sport. After friends' referrals started becoming too plentiful
        to manage on her own, Gene requested that a website be developed to 
        serve as an information guide for prospective customers (to let them
        know exactly what they are getting into, including safety precautions,
        etc), a way to outline packages and other services,
        and a way for her guests to reserve 'time slots' 
        for her services.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The target audience for this water rafting website is middle-aged,
            thrill-seeking individuals with expendable income. These include both 
            beginners with zero experience, as well as returning customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Who are the target customers? Describe their life 
            (or business) situation (age, financial situation, 
            interests, and so on)</strong>
            <br>
            Typically middle-aged individuals (aged 20-35). Generally
            speaking they will be thrill-seekers, and tend to be 
            individuals or couples without children. Financially, they
            will be well-off (middle or upper class), and most will have 
            a love for the outdoors and other outdoorsy activities,
            including other water sports. For the purpose of Gene's website,
            two crowds of people will be visiting Gene's website and accessing
            her services: absolute beginners, and those who are returning, 
            loyal customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by 
                them accessing the website?</strong>
            <br>
            Users of this website will be seeking information about: what types of
            services/packages are available ('rafting adventures, lessons, etc'), and
            will want to know price details. When they access the site they'll be able
            to find this information, as well as how to prepare for the adventure they
            have selected, and how to contact Gene (the owner).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What are their needs that aren't being met?</strong>
            <br>
            Because of the sheer number of customers that Gene has started receiving,
            her business has taken an exciting turn from 'casual' to 'serious.' The
            sheer number of people trying to contact her is overwhelming with everything
            else that she has going on in her life, and she finds it difficult to answer
            all of their questions and to be thorough as she juggles several customers
            with varying levels of experience, etc. This website will meet her customer's
            needs by providing all of the necessary information about their adventures in an
            easily accesible website, as well as allowing them to sign up for an adventure at
            any time of day instead of having to wait until Gene answers the phone. Faster
            and far more convenient for all involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, 
                mobile device)?</strong>
            <br>
            I assume their laptop (middle-aged people tend to appreciate the capabilities
            of a laptop when it comes to high levels of planning, which would probably be
            involved because their WWR adventure is probably connected to a larger adventure,
            eg: vacation, etc), although all 3 will be available to them.
