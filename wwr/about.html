                    Beginning as weekend adventure outings with friends, Whitewater Rafting Co.
                    started small and very quickly built momentum. What started as a couple of friends
                    hitting the rapids every weekend quickly turned into paid expeditions for 
                    adventure-seeking individuals and groups.

                    These were those who wanted professional guidance

                    of their entire lives.
