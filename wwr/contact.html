                <h3>Brenda Bochman</h3>
                <p>Brenda is our champion adventure leader. 29 years old and full
                of life, she never misses an opportunity to take the waves at full
                throttle. Adrenaline-junkie extraordinaire, Brenda knows how to handle
                the water when it's calm, but more importantly she knows how to have
                a heck of a lot of fun when the waves come crashing.

                <h3>Lenny Lordando</h3>
                <p>
                26 years in the industry has taught Lenny one thing: life is 
                full of risk. To him, it's all about picking the most fun risks
                and making the most of every situation. Lenny has been safety trained 
                with the greats, like Henry Gorgin and even Helen Gravado, and he prides
                himself on being one of the first white water rafters to make it into
                the Guiness Book of World Records for rafting down a current blindfolded.

                <h3>Frederick "Footless Freddy" Flunedrin</h3>
                <p>
                Footless Freddy is our leader in family fun on the rapids. Freddy leads 
                our more casual groups of rafters, despite being one of our strongest team 
                members. With his calm demeanour and humour to entertain kids and adults alike,
                you'll forget your fears and feel at ease on any wave.
